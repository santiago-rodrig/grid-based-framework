# Grid-based framework

## Goal
To use a CSS framework made by yourself and implement it with any page you'll
like to replicate. In this project the intention was to replicate [The Odin Project website]('https://www.theodinproject.com/') with the new framework.

## Chill Grid Framework
The created 12 columns based grid framework was made using CSS3 grid and SASS, and includes columns with auto break-points for better responsiveness, together with display break points and basic spacing and styling classes.
